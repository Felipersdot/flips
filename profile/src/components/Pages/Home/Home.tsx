                UML diagrams were used to solidify associations between classes,
                interfaces, and proper data structures within classes, to ensure
                cohesive operations between instances of multiple classes.
                Design patterns such as Fa√ßade, Decorator, and Observer were
                used between the development of the classes. Allowing instances
                of classes to be responsive based on the appropriate events that
                were taking place by their respective instances. This was
                ensured by using core Java concepts related to Object Oriented
                Programming: Inheritance, Encapsulation, Polymorphism, and Data
                abstraction. Finally, examining code by testing for exceptions
                and refactoring master code to its GUI using the Java Swing
                Library. Finalizing all documentation on the API and releasing
                sets for general users and developers respectively.

                Implementing a dynamic application that handles requests and
                data presented by the user. Implementation was done using HTML
                CSS JS PHP and SQL. Implementation of database design was done
                using concepts of normalization of the 3rd degree. Event-driven
                programming skills were integrated to dynamically break data
                entries given by users and interact with the DBMS as needed.
                Advanced SQL techniques will then be used to redesign the
                architecture of the database while maintaining the integrity of
                the data.
