          I am a full stack developer, aspiring to make meaningful impacts by
          continuously integrating new findings and studies into current
          practices. I carry a keen interest for the optimization and
          enhancement of current infrastructure by analyzing its fundamentals
          and assessing areas of interest to increase productivity, reduce
          latency, and enhance user experience. I continuously maintain my
          skills by contributing to the APIs of open source projects, reviewing
          documentation, correlating their objectives with the program's ability
          to perform, and assessing the performance metrics to isolate areas of
          possible improvements.

                UML diagrams were used to solidify associations between classes,
                interfaces, and proper data structures within classes, to ensure
                cohesive operations between instances of multiple classes.
                Design patterns such as Fa√ßade, Decorator, and Observer were
                used between the development of the classes. Allowing instances
                of classes to be responsive based on the appropriate events that
                were taking place by their respective instances. This was
                ensured by using core Java concepts related to Object Oriented
                Programming: Inheritance, Encapsulation, Polymorphism, and Data
                abstraction. Finally, examining code by testing for exceptions
                and refactoring master code to its GUI using the Java Swing
                Library. Finalizing all documentation on the API and releasing
                sets for general users and developers respectively.

                Implementing a dynamic application that handles requests and

                CSS JS PHP and SQL. Implementation of database design was done
                using concepts of normalization of the 3rd degree. Event-driven
                programming skills were integrated to dynamically break data
                entries given by users and interact with the DBMS as needed.
                Advanced SQL techniques will then be used to redesign the
